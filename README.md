## Tokenize
Tokenize allows anyone to deploy an Ethereum Token without the need to write solidity code.
Tokenize at the momment only supports the creation of **ERC20** tokens but **ERC223**, **ERC721** and **ERC777** are coming soon.
This project was made using the React framework.

## How to use
In order to use **Tokenize** install the [Metamask extension](https://metamask.io/) for your browser or use a browser with Ethereum support such as Opera Beta.
